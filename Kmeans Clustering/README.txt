Compiling Assignment5.py will require matplotlib and numpy.

After running the python file, a prompt to enter an image filename will appear. After entering the
image filename, the program should require no more input from the user.

The program will automatically run the K-means clustering algorithm on the image with K values of
2, 5, 10, 15, and 20. Once completed, it should output image files for each K value.
